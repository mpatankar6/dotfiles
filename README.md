My setup mostly revolves around [Nix](https://nixos.org/). I have taken a
pragmatic approach, and while Nix is awesome, for me it isn't the be all and
end all of system configuration.

## Inspiration & Discussion
Feel free to make suggestions or ask questions. I love talking about this
stuff, and I'd love to see your dotfiles as well.
