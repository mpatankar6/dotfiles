My setup revolves around [Nix](https://nixos.org/), though I have taken a 
slightly pragmatic approach. While Nix is awesome, for me, it isn't the be-all
and end-all of system configuration.

## Inspiration & Discussion
Feel free to make suggestions or ask questions. I love talking about this
stuff, and I'd love to see your dotfiles as well.
